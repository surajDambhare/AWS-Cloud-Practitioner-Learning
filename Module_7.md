# üìò Module 7: Monitoring and Analytics in AWS

Monitoring and analytics are essential in AWS because they help you **track your resources, analyze logs, identify issues, and optimize costs**. In this module, we‚Äôll cover three key services:

* **Amazon CloudWatch** ‚Üí Real-time monitoring
* **AWS CloudTrail** ‚Üí Auditing and governance
* **AWS Trusted Advisor** ‚Üí Best-practice recommendations

## üîπ Topic A: Amazon CloudWatch

### 1. What is CloudWatch?

Amazon CloudWatch is a **monitoring and observability service** for AWS resources and applications. It collects:

* **Metrics** (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage)
* **Logs** (application/system logs)
* **Events** (changes in environment)
* **Alarms** (alerts when something goes wrong)

Think of CloudWatch as **AWS‚Äôs monitoring dashboard** where you can **see what‚Äôs happening in real-time**.

---

### 2. Key Features of CloudWatch

1. **Metrics** ‚Üí Collects and stores resource performance data.

    * Example: CPU utilization of an EC2 instance.
2. **Logs** ‚Üí Collects and monitors log files from applications and AWS services.

    * Example: Error logs from Lambda or Apache server logs.
3. **Alarms** ‚Üí Trigger actions when thresholds are crossed.

    * Example: Send an alert if CPU usage > 80%.
4. **Dashboards** ‚Üí Visualize metrics in graphs and charts.

    * Example: A custom dashboard showing EC2 + RDS + S3 usage.
5. **Events (Amazon EventBridge)** ‚Üí React to changes in AWS environment.

    * Example: Automatically trigger a Lambda function if an EC2 instance stops.

---

### 3. Example Use Cases of CloudWatch

* **EC2 Instance Monitoring**: Get alerts if CPU usage is too high.
* **Application Logs Monitoring**: Analyze logs to debug errors.
* **Auto Scaling**: Scale up/down instances automatically based on demand.
* **Billing Alerts**: Get notified when AWS monthly cost exceeds a limit.

---

### 4. Real-World Example

Imagine you run an **E-commerce Website** hosted on EC2 + RDS.

* CloudWatch tracks CPU usage, memory, and database queries.
* If traffic spikes during a sale ‚Üí CPU hits 90%.
* CloudWatch triggers an **Alarm** ‚Üí Auto Scaling adds 2 new EC2 instances.
* Customers continue shopping smoothly üöÄ.

## üîπ Topic B: AWS CloudTrail

### 1. What is CloudTrail?

AWS CloudTrail is a **logging and auditing service**.
It records **all API calls and actions** taken in your AWS account.

Think of it as a **security camera** for your AWS environment.

---

### 2. Key Features of CloudTrail

1. **Event History** ‚Üí See who did what, when, and from where.

    * Example: ‚ÄúUser John stopped an EC2 instance at 10:30 AM.‚Äù
2. **Multi-Region Trails** ‚Üí Track API calls across all regions.
3. **Integration with CloudWatch** ‚Üí Monitor suspicious activities.
4. **Data Events** ‚Üí Track actions at the object level (e.g., S3 object uploads/deletes).

---

### 3. Example Use Cases of CloudTrail

* **Security Auditing** ‚Üí Check if unauthorized users accessed resources.
* **Compliance** ‚Üí Maintain logs for regulations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR).
* **Troubleshooting** ‚Üí Find who deleted an S3 bucket by mistake.
* **Monitoring Data Access** ‚Üí Track file uploads/downloads in S3.

---

### 4. Real-World Example

You discover an **S3 bucket is deleted**.

* Without CloudTrail ‚Üí You don‚Äôt know who deleted it.
* With CloudTrail ‚Üí You check logs and see:

  ```
  User: IAM-User-Dev  
  Action: DeleteBucket  
  Time: 2025-09-10 10:32:45 UTC  
  ```

‚úÖ Now you know **who did it, when, and how**.

## üîπ Topic C: AWS Trusted Advisor

### 1. What is Trusted Advisor?

AWS Trusted Advisor is like a **cloud consultant**.
It analyzes your AWS account and gives **best-practice recommendations** to improve:

* **Cost Optimization**
* **Performance**
* **Security**
* **Fault Tolerance**
* **Service Limits**

---

### 2. Key Features of Trusted Advisor

1. **Cost Optimization** ‚Üí Find unused EC2 instances or underutilized resources.
2. **Performance** ‚Üí Suggests better configurations for high performance.
3. **Security** ‚Üí Alerts on weak security practices (e.g., open ports, IAM policies).
4. **Fault Tolerance** ‚Üí Ensures backup and redundancy.
5. **Service Limits** ‚Üí Warns when you are nearing AWS limits (e.g., max EC2 per region).

---

### 3. Example Use Cases of Trusted Advisor

* **Reduce Costs** ‚Üí Identifies unused Elastic IPs or idle EC2.
* **Improve Security** ‚Üí Alerts if your S3 bucket is public.
* **Ensure Reliability** ‚Üí Checks if Auto Scaling is configured properly.

---

### 4. Real-World Example

Your company receives a **Trusted Advisor alert**:

* "You have 5 EC2 instances running at <5% CPU for 30 days."
* Action: Stop or downsize them ‚Üí Save **\$300/month**.
  üí° This makes cloud usage **cost-effective and efficient**.
