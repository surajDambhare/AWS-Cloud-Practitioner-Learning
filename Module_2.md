# AWS Module 2 - Detailed Notes

## Topic A: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

### What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can think of it as renting a computer in AWS that you can use whenever needed. Instead of buying hardware, you launch virtual machines (instances).

**Why EC2?**

* Launch servers in minutes.
* Scale up or down based on traffic.
* Pay only for what you use.

**Example:**

* Without EC2: Buy 5 physical servers → pay upfront → handle traffic spikes manually.
* With EC2: Start with 2 instances → traffic increases → add more instances automatically → pay only for extra instances.

**EC2 Basics Diagram:**

```

                         v
                [ Security Groups, Firewalls, Load Balancers ]
```

### EC2 Key Features

| Feature       | Explanation                       | Real-World Use Case                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Elasticity    | Can scale up/down based on demand | Auto-scaling e-commerce site            |
| Pay-as-you-go | Only pay for running time         | Testing a new app for 3 hours           |
| Multiple OS   | Linux, Windows, macOS             | Run Windows apps or Linux web servers   |
| Global Reach  | Instances in multiple regions     | Deploy app close to customers worldwide |
| Secure        | IAM, Security Groups, Key Pairs   | Restrict access, encrypt data           |

### EC2 Instance Lifecycle

1. Launch an instance: Choose OS (AMI), instance type, network, storage.
2. Connect to the instance: Linux → SSH, Windows → RDP.
3. Install Applications: Web server, database, application code.
4. Manage Instances: Stop → temporarily stop, Start → resume, Terminate → permanently delete.

## Topic B: Amazon EC2 Instance Types


## 1. What is an EC2 Instance Type?

An EC2 Instance Type defines the hardware resources of your virtual machine in AWS:

* CPU (vCPUs) → How fast the instance can process tasks
* Memory (RAM) → How much data it can store temporarily while working
* Storage → Local disk space or volume
* Networking Capacity → How fast data can move in/out

Think of it like buying a laptop:

* Some laptops are lightweight → low CPU, small RAM → good for browsing.
* Some are gaming laptops → high CPU, lots of RAM → good for heavy tasks.

AWS gives you different “laptops” (instances) for different workloads.

---

## 2. EC2 Instance Families

### A. General Purpose Instances

* Balanced CPU + Memory
* Good for most applications that don’t need heavy CPU or RAM
* Examples: `t3.micro`, `t3.small`, `m5.large`

**Use Cases:**

* Small/medium web servers
* Development and test environments
* Small databases

**Example Scenario:**
Hosting a blog or small website. Traffic is normal, no heavy computation → use `t3.micro` (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM), Free tier eligible.

### B. Compute Optimized Instances

* High CPU performance, moderate memory
* Great for CPU-heavy tasks like calculations or batch processing
* Examples: `c5.large`, `c6g.xlarge`

**Use Cases:**

* Gaming servers
* Scientific computing
* Video encoding
* Batch processing

**Example Scenario:**
Running image processing tasks for thousands of images → each task is CPU-intensive → use `c5.large`.

### C. Memory Optimized Instances

* High RAM, moderate CPU
* For applications that need lots of memory
* Examples: `r5.large`, `x1e.32xlarge`

**Use Cases:**

* Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
* In-memory caches (Redis, Memcached)
* Real-time big data analytics

**Example Scenario:**
Running a Redis cache to speed up website. Needs 20GB RAM → use `r5.4xlarge`.

### D. Storage Optimized Instances

* High disk I/O, fast storage access
* Great for workloads needing lots of read/write operations
* Examples: `i3.large`, `d2.xlarge`, `h1.4xlarge`

**Use Cases:**

* Big Data processing (Hadoop, Spark)
* Data warehouses
* Logging systems

**Example Scenario:**
Running Hadoop cluster to analyze huge log files → choose `i3.16xlarge` with fast SSD storage.

### E. Accelerated Computing Instances

* GPU or FPGA-based, specialized hardware
* For workloads needing parallel processing power
* Examples: `p3.2xlarge`, `g4dn.xlarge`, `f1.2xlarge`

**Use Cases:**

* Machine learning / AI model training
* 3D rendering
* Video transcoding

**Example Scenario:**
Training a deep learning model → huge matrix computations → GPU-based `p3.2xlarge` gives faster training than CPU.

## 3. How to Choose the Right Instance Type

1. Identify workload needs: CPU-bound, memory-bound, storage-bound, GPU-required
2. Choose instance family: General purpose, compute, memory, storage, accelerated
3. Choose size within family: Small, medium, large, xlarge → based on resource requirements
4. Test & Monitor: Start with small → check CPU/memory utilization → scale up if needed

---

## 4. Quick Reference Table

| Instance Type            | Optimized For         | Example Use Case             | When to Use                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

## Key Takeaways

* General Purpose → all-rounder
* Compute → CPU-intensive
* Memory → RAM-intensive
* Storage → Disk-intensive
* Accelerated → GPU/FPGAs

---

## Topic C: Amazon EC2 Pricing


Amazon EC2 pricing depends on how you want to use your instances (servers). AWS offers different pricing models so you can save money depending on your workload.

---

## 1. On-Demand Instances

### What is it?

* You pay by the hour or second for EC2 instances.
* No long-term commitment.
* Flexible and simple.

### When to use it:

* Temporary workloads or experiments
* Applications with unpredictable traffic
* Testing or development servers

### Example:

* You need a server to test a new website for 3 hours → launch an On-Demand instance, test your site, stop it → pay only for 3 hours.

✅ Pros: Flexible, no upfront cost
❌ Cons: More expensive if used continuously

---

## 2. Reserved Instances

### What is it?

* You commit to using an instance for 1 or 3 years.
* In return, AWS gives you a significant discount (up to 72%).

### When to use it:

* Applications with steady, predictable workloads
* Long-term production servers

### Example:

* Your company has a website running 24/7 → reserve instances for 1 year → pay less than On-Demand pricing.

✅ Pros: Huge savings for steady workloads
❌ Cons: You must commit for a long time

---

## 3. Spot Instances

### What is it?

* Spot Instances let you use unused AWS capacity at a very low price.
* AWS can reclaim the instance anytime if they need the capacity.

### When to use it:

* Batch jobs or background processing
* Tasks that are flexible and can stop/restart

### Example:

* Running a data analysis job overnight → use Spot Instances → save up to 90% compared to On-Demand.

✅ Pros: Very cheap
❌ Cons: Can be interrupted anytime

---

## 4. Savings Plans

### What is it?

* You commit to spend a fixed amount per hour on AWS for 1 or 3 years.
* AWS automatically applies discounts to any EC2 instance usage.

### When to use it:

* Mixed workloads where you want flexibility and cost savings
* You don’t want to manage individual Reserved Instances

### Example:

* Your company spends \~\$5/hour on EC2 → commit to \$5/hour Savings Plan → get discount on all EC2 usage.

✅ Pros: Flexible, automatic savings
❌ Cons: Still requires a spending commitment

---

## 5. Dedicated Hosts

### What is it?

* Physical server dedicated to your use only.
* Needed for compliance or software licensing.

### When to use it:

* Applications with specific licensing requirements
* Applications requiring full control over the server

### Example:

* Running legacy enterprise software that only allows licensed CPUs → use Dedicated Host.

✅ Pros: Full control, compliance-friendly
❌ Cons: Expensive

---

## 6. Billing Components

Even within any pricing model, EC2 charges can include:

1. Instance Hours → cost of running your EC2 instance
2. Storage (EBS) → attached disk space
3. Data Transfer → outbound traffic (into internet)
4. Elastic IP → only pay if unused

---

## 7. How to Choose Which Plan to Use

| Workload Type                 | Recommended Pricing Model | Example                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Temporary, unpredictable      | On-Demand                 | Testing a new website for 3 hours   |
| Steady, 24/7 usage            | Reserved                  | Production website running all year |
| Flexible, interruptible       | Spot                      | Overnight batch processing          |
| Mixed, want savings           | Savings Plans             | Multiple apps with varying usage    |
| Compliance or licensing needs | Dedicated Host            | Enterprise legacy software          |

---

## 8. Simple Takeaways

* On-Demand: Pay as you go, flexible, short-term
* Reserved: Commit for 1–3 years, save money, steady usage
* Spot: Cheap, flexible, can be interrupted
* Savings Plan: Flexible, automatic discounts, long-term savings
* Dedicated Host: Full physical server, compliance, expensive

---

## Example Scenario in Real Life

* A startup testing a new app → On-Demand
* E-commerce website running 24/7 → Reserved
* Nightly data analysis → Spot
* Multiple apps for 3-year project → Savings Plan
* Legacy licensed app → Dedicated Host


---

## Topic D: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

#### 1. What is EC2 Auto Scaling?

EC2 Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand.

* If your app gets more traffic → Auto Scaling adds more instances
* If traffic drops → Auto Scaling removes instances

**Goal:** Keep your app available, fast, and cost-efficient.

**Simple Analogy:**

* Imagine a restaurant:

    * Few customers → 2 chefs working
    * Many customers → automatically call 5 chefs
    * Customers leave → reduce chefs back to 2

---

#### 2. Why Use Auto Scaling?

1. **Handle Traffic Spikes**

    * Your app can grow/shrink automatically based on traffic.
    * Example: E-commerce site during Black Friday.

2. **High Availability**

    * Auto Scaling ensures there are always healthy instances running.
    * If an instance fails → Auto Scaling replaces it.

3. **Cost Efficiency**

    * You don’t pay for unused instances.
    * Only scale up when needed.

---

#### 3. Key Components of EC2 Auto Scaling

| Component                | Function                                                                  | Example                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch Template          | Defines how instances are created (AMI, instance type, storage, key pair) | EC2 instance with Ubuntu, 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM         |
| Auto Scaling Group (ASG) | Group of instances managed together                                       | Web server group                                  |
| Scaling Policies         | Rules to add/remove instances                                             | Scale out when CPU > 70%, scale in when CPU < 30% |
| Health Checks            | Automatically replace unhealthy instances                                 | Replace a crashed instance automatically          |

---

#### 4. How EC2 Auto Scaling Works (Step by Step)

1. **Create Launch Template**

    * Decide OS, instance type, key pair, storage, security group.

2. **Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

    * Specify minimum, maximum, and desired number of instances.

3. **Set Scaling Policies**

    * Add rules to scale in/out based on metrics like CPU, network, or custom CloudWatch alarms.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**

    * Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes instances as needed.

---

#### 5. Example Scenario

#### Scenario: Online Store

| Metric                    | Action                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Normal traffic            | 2 instances running                             |
| Traffic spike (CPU > 70%) | Auto Scaling adds 4 more instances (total 6)    |
| Traffic drops (CPU < 30%) | Auto Scaling removes extra instances, back to 2 |

* Ensures website doesn’t crash during high demand
* Saves money when traffic is low

---

#### 6. Benefits in Simple Words

* **Automatic:** No manual intervention to manage servers
* **Reliable:** Replaces unhealthy instances automatically
* **Scalable:** Handles sudden traffic spikes smoothly
* **Cost-efficient:** Only pay for what you need

---

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

* EC2 Auto Scaling = automatic scaling of EC2 instances
* Keeps apps highly available and responsive
* Reduces manual server management and costs
* Works best with Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for even traffic distribution

---

## Topic E: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)


#### 1. What is ELB?

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a service in AWS that distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances (servers).

**Goal:** Ensure your application is highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable.

**Simple Analogy:**

* Imagine a restaurant with multiple chefs:

    * Customers come in → a manager directs each customer to a free chef
    * Prevents any single chef from getting overloaded
* ELB does the same for web traffic: it balances requests across multiple servers.

---

#### 2. Why Use ELB?

1. **Distribute Traffic**

    * Automatically spreads incoming traffic to all healthy instances
    * Prevents any single server from getting overloaded

2. **Increase Availability**

    * If an instance fails, ELB routes traffic to healthy instances automatically

3. **Scale Applications**

    * Works with Auto Scaling to add/remove instances based on demand

4. **Security Features**

    * Supports SSL/TLS encryption
    * Can integrate with AWS WAF for protection against attacks

---

#### 3. Types of ELB

AWS provides three types of ELB:

| Type                            | Use Case                                                 | Key Features                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application Load Balancer (ALB) | Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (web apps)                   | Layer 7 load balancing, path-based routing, host-based routing, SSL termination |
| Network Load Balancer (NLB)     | High-performance TCP/UDP traffic (low latency)           | Layer 4 load balancing, handles millions of requests/sec, static IP support     |
| Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)     | Deploy and scale virtual appliances (firewalls, routers) | Layer 3 load balancing, integrates third-party appliances                       |

---

#### 4. How ELB Works (Step by Step)

1. **Create Load Balancer**

    * Choose type: ALB, NLB, or GLB
    * Configure listeners (protocols & ports)

2. **Register Targets**

    * Add EC2 instances or IP addresses as targets

3. **Health Checks**

    * ELB monitors the health of registered instances
    * Unhealthy instances are automatically removed from traffic routing

4. **Routing Traffic**

    * Requests are distributed according to routing rules
    * Example: Path-based routing → `/images` goes to one target group, `/videos` goes to another

---

#### 5. Example Scenario

### Scenario: E-commerce Website

| Event                      | Action                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1000 users access `/home`  | ELB distributes traffic to 3 EC2 instances                                                             |
| One instance fails         | ELB stops sending traffic to the failed instance, users still access website                           |
| Traffic spikes during sale | Works with Auto Scaling → adds 2 more instances automatically, ELB balances traffic across 5 instances |

**Result:**

* Website remains fast, available, and responsive
* No single server is overloaded

---

#### 6. Benefits 

* **High Availability:** Ensures your app stays online even if some servers fail
* **Scalability:** Can handle sudden traffic spikes
* **Security:** Supports SSL/TLS and integrates with firewalls
* **Fault Tolerant:** Automatically removes unhealthy instances

---

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

* ELB = distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances
* Prevents server overload and downtime
* Works best with Auto Scaling for dynamic scaling
* Three types of ELB: ALB, NLB, GLB
* Essential for building reliable and scalable web applications


---

## Topic F: AWS Messaging Services

#### 1. What are AWS Messaging Services?

AWS Messaging Services are services that allow applications, systems, and microservices to communicate with each other by sending messages or notifications.

**Goal:** Ensure reliable, asynchronous communication between different components of an application.

**Simple Analogy:**

* Think of it as a postal service for applications:

   * App A wants to send data to App B → sends a “message” → AWS messaging service delivers it reliably

---

#### 2. Why Use Messaging Services?

1. **Decoupling Applications**

   * Sender and receiver do not need to know about each other
   * Makes applications more flexible and scalable

2. **Asynchronous Communication**

   * Sender can send a message without waiting for receiver to process it
   * Example: Order processing system – orders can be queued and processed later

3. **Reliability**

   * Messages are stored until successfully delivered
   * Ensures no data is lost

4. **Scalability**

   * Can handle millions of messages per second

---

#### 3. Key AWS Messaging Services

| Service                                  | Type                                       | Use Case                              | Example                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)        | Message queue                              | Decouple microservices, queue tasks   | Order processing: Queue orders, workers process them asynchronously |
| Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) | Pub/Sub, notifications                     | Send messages to multiple subscribers | Alert system: Send notifications to multiple apps, email, or SMS    |
| Amazon MQ                                | Managed message broker (ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ) | Migrate legacy messaging apps         | Enterprise app using JMS for inter-service communication            |
| Amazon EventBridge                       | Event bus, event-driven architecture       | Connect app events across services    | Automatically trigger workflows when a new file is uploaded to S3   |

---

#### 4. How AWS Messaging Works (Step by Step)

#### Example 1: Using SQS

1. **Producer sends a message** to an SQS queue
2. **Queue stores messages** until a consumer is ready
3. **Consumer retrieves messages** from the queue and processes them

#### Example 2: Using SNS

1. **Publisher sends a notification** to an SNS topic
2. **SNS delivers message** to multiple subscribers simultaneously

   * Subscribers can be EC2 instances, Lambda functions, email, or SMS

---

#### 5. Example Scenario

#### Scenario: E-commerce Application

* **Order placed by customer:**

   * App sends order details to SQS queue
   * Multiple worker services pick up orders asynchronously and process them

* **Inventory alert:**

   * App publishes a message to SNS topic
   * Subscribers like email, SMS, or warehouse system get notified immediately

**Result:**

* Orders are processed efficiently and reliably
* Alerts are delivered to multiple systems automatically

---

#### 6. Benefits

* **Decoupling:** Apps don’t depend on each other directly
* **Reliability:** Messages are safely stored until processed
* **Scalability:** Handles large volumes of messages
* **Flexibility:** Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, Lambda, email, SMS, SQS)
* **Event-driven architectures:** Automate workflows based on events

---

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

* AWS Messaging Services = communication backbone for distributed systems
* **SQS** → Queue-based, asynchronous tasks
* **SNS** → Publish/subscribe notifications
* **Amazon MQ** → Managed broker for legacy apps
* **EventBridge** → Event-driven application architecture
* Used for decoupling, scalability, reliability, and asynchronous communication

## Topic G: Serverless Compute Services

#### 1. What is Serverless Compute?

Serverless Compute Services allow you to run your code without managing servers.

* You just write your code and upload it.
* AWS automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure.
* You pay only for the compute time used, not for idle servers.

**Simple Analogy:**

* Imagine a restaurant ordering system:

    * You only pay for the meals you order, not for the whole kitchen 24/7
    * The kitchen automatically scales if many orders come in
* Serverless works the same way for running code: AWS handles servers automatically.

---

#### 2. Why Use Serverless Compute?

1. **No Server Management**

    * No need to set up or maintain servers
    * Focus only on writing code

2. **Automatic Scaling**

    * Handles any number of requests automatically
    * Scale up during traffic spikes, scale down during idle times

3. **Cost Efficiency**

    * Pay only for the compute time your code runs
    * No cost for idle time

4. **Quick Deployment**

    * Faster to deploy and iterate on code
    * Ideal for microservices or event-driven applications

---

#### 3. Key AWS Serverless Compute Services

| Service        | Type                               | Use Case                                      | Example                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS Lambda     | Function as a Service (FaaS)       | Run code without servers, triggered by events | Automatically resize images when uploaded to S3                       |
| AWS Fargate    | Container-based serverless compute | Run containers without managing servers       | Run a containerized web app without EC2                               |
| AWS App Runner | Serverless application deployment  | Deploy web apps and APIs quickly              | Deploy a Node.js web app directly from source code or container image |

---

#### 4. How Serverless Compute Works (Step by Step)

#### Example: Using AWS Lambda

1. **Write Function Code**

    * Example: Resize an image when uploaded to S3

2. **Upload to Lambda**

    * AWS automatically provisions servers to run your code

3. **Trigger Function**

    * Event-based triggers: S3 upload, API Gateway request, DynamoDB update

4. **AWS Executes Function**

    * Code runs only when triggered
    * Scales automatically if multiple events occur at the same time

5. **Pay Only for Execution Time**

    * Billing based on number of requests and execution duration

---

#### 5. Example Scenario

#### Scenario: Photo-sharing App

* **Upload Photo** → User uploads an image to S3
* **Lambda Function Triggered** → Automatically resizes the image and stores it in a different S3 bucket
* **API Gateway** → Serves the resized image to users
* **Scale** → Handles thousands of uploads simultaneously without managing servers

**Result:**

* Users get processed images quickly
* Developers don’t manage servers
* Costs are low because you pay only for execution time

---

#### 6. Benefits in Simple Words

* **No Server Management:** Focus only on code
* **Scalable:** Handles traffic spikes automatically
* **Cost-efficient:** Only pay when code runs
* **Event-driven:** Integrates easily with other AWS services
* **Fast Deployment:** Quick to develop and deploy microservices

---

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

* Serverless Compute = run code without managing servers
* **AWS Lambda** → Function triggered by events
* **AWS Fargate** → Serverless container compute
* **AWS App Runner** → Deploy web apps and APIs easily
* Best for event-driven applications, microservices, and cost-efficient computing

## Topic H: AWS Container Services

#### 1. What are AWS Container Services?

AWS Container Services are services that let you run, manage, and scale containerized applications in the cloud.

* **Container:** A lightweight package that contains your app and all its dependencies so it can run anywhere
* Containers are isolated, portable, and fast to start

**Goal:** Simplify deployment, scaling, and management of apps using containers

**Simple Analogy:**

* Think of containers as shipping containers for apps:

    * A shipping container can carry goods anywhere without worrying about the vehicle
    * Similarly, containers carry your app and run it anywhere consistently

---

#### 2. Why Use AWS Container Services?

1. **Portability**

    * Apps run the same way on different environments (local, cloud, or on-premises)

2. **Scalability**

    * Easily scale containers up or down depending on traffic

3. **Isolation**

    * Containers are isolated from each other, improving security and reliability

4. **Efficient Resource Use**

    * Multiple containers can share the same host efficiently

5. **Fast Deployment**

    * Containerized apps start quickly compared to traditional servers

#### 3. Key AWS Container Services

| Service                                 | Type                            | Use Case                                               | Example                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)  | Managed container orchestration | Run and scale Docker containers easily                 | Deploy a web application with multiple microservices      |
| Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) | Managed Kubernetes service      | Run Kubernetes clusters without managing control plane | Deploy a microservice architecture using Kubernetes       |
| AWS Fargate                             | Serverless container compute    | Run containers without managing servers                | Run containerized APIs without provisioning EC2 instances |
| Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) | Container registry              | Store and manage Docker images securely                | Store Docker images for web app deployment                |

---

#### 4. How AWS Container Services Work (Step by Step)

#### Example: Deploying a Containerized Web App using ECS

1. **Create Docker Image**

    * Package your application and dependencies in a Docker image

2. **Push to Amazon ECR**

    * Store your image in AWS’s container registry

3. **Create ECS Cluster**

    * A group of EC2 instances or Fargate tasks to run containers

4. **Deploy Containers**

    * Launch container tasks using ECS or Fargate
    * ELB can distribute traffic across containers for high availability

5. **Scale Containers**

    * Auto Scaling adds/removes container instances based on demand

---

#### 5. Example Scenario

#### Scenario: Microservices-based Online Store

* **User Service, Order Service, Inventory Service** → Each runs in a separate container
* **ECS Cluster** → Hosts all containers
* **Traffic Spike during Sale** → Auto Scaling adds more containers automatically
* **ELB** → Distributes incoming requests evenly to all containers

**Result:**

* High availability, scalability, and reliable performance
* Easy deployment and updates without downtime

---

#### 6. Benefits

* **Portability:** Containers run anywhere consistently
* **Scalability:** Easy to scale containers as needed
* **Isolation:** Containers don’t interfere with each other
* **Efficiency:** Better resource utilization than traditional VMs
* **Fast Deployment:** Quickly deploy and update apps

---

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

* AWS Container Services = run, manage, and scale containerized apps in the cloud
* **Amazon ECS** → Managed Docker container orchestration
* **Amazon EKS** → Managed Kubernetes service
* **AWS Fargate** → Serverless container compute
* **Amazon ECR** → Secure container image storage
* Best for microservices, scalable apps, and modern cloud-native applications
