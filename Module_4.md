## Topic A: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

### What is Amazon VPC?
- **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)** is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where you can launch and manage resources like EC2 instances, databases, and load balancers.
- Think of it as your own private data center within AWS, where you have full control over:
    - IP address ranges
    - Subnets
    - Route tables
    - Internet connectivity
    - Security

---

### Default VPC vs Custom VPC
- **Default VPC**:
    - Automatically created in each AWS region.
    - Includes one subnet per Availability Zone (AZ).
    - Easy for beginners to quickly launch resources without custom setup.
- **Custom VPC**:
    - You create and configure from scratch.
    - More flexibility and control (IP ranges, security, routing).
    - Best practice for production workloads.

---

### Key Components of VPC
1. **Subnets**
    - Divisions of the VPCâ€™s IP address range.
    - Types:
        - **Public Subnet**: Connected to the internet (via Internet Gateway).
        - **Private Subnet**: Isolated from the internet, used for databases or internal services.

2. **Route Tables**
    - Define rules for where network traffic should go.
    - Example: Route public traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.

3. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
    - A gateway attached to your VPC that enables resources in a public subnet to access the internet.

4. **NAT Gateway**
    - Allows private subnet resources to access the internet (for updates, downloads) without exposing them to incoming traffic.

5. **VPC Peering**
    - Connects two VPCs privately across the same or different AWS accounts/regions.

---

### Example Scenario
Imagine youâ€™re hosting a web application:
- Web servers in a **public subnet** (so users can access it over the internet).
- Databases in a **private subnet** (protected from direct internet access).
- A **NAT Gateway** allows the database servers to download security patches without being publicly accessible.

---

## Topic B: Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and Security Groups

### What are Security Groups?
- Virtual firewalls at the **instance level**.
- **Stateful**: If you allow inbound traffic, the response outbound is automatically allowed.
- Rules are **whitelist-based**: only allow the traffic you specify.

Example:
- Allow inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS).
- Allow SSH access (port 22) only from your office IP.

---

### What are Network ACLs?
- Virtual firewalls at the **subnet level**.
- **Stateless**: Inbound and outbound rules must be defined separately.
- Rules can **allow or deny** traffic.

Example:
- Allow inbound HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).
- Deny traffic from a suspicious IP range.

---

### Comparison: Security Groups vs NACLs

| Feature              | Security Groups                  | Network ACLs                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Level of Control      | Instance level                  | Subnet level                  |
| Stateful/Stateless    | Stateful                        | Stateless                     |
| Allow/Deny Rules      | Only Allow                      | Allow and Deny                |
| Default Behavior      | Deny all until allowed          | Allow all until changed       |

---

### Example Use Case
- Use a **Security Group** to tightly control access to your EC2 instances (e.g., allow only HTTPS).
- Use a **NACL** to block an entire range of suspicious IP addresses at the subnet level.

---

## Topic C: Interacting with the AWS Global Network

### What is the AWS Global Network?
- AWS operates a **high-speed, private global fiber network** that connects data centers, edge locations, and regions worldwide.
- Ensures **low latency, high availability, and secure communication** between resources.

---

### Key Services for Global Networking
1. **Amazon CloudFront**
    - Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content closer to users via **edge locations**.

2. **AWS Global Accelerator**
    - Improves availability and performance by routing traffic through AWSâ€™s global backbone.

3. **VPC Peering & Transit Gateway**
    - Connect VPCs across regions/accounts.
    - Transit Gateway simplifies hub-and-spoke networking.

4. **Direct Connect**
    - Private, dedicated connection between your data center and AWS.
    - Provides lower latency and higher bandwidth than the internet.

---

### Benefits of AWS Global Network
- **Low Latency**: Traffic uses AWSâ€™s private backbone instead of the public internet.
- **High Availability**: Multiple redundant connections.
- **Security**: Built-in encryption and isolation.
- **Global Reach**: Access to resources and users worldwide.

---

### Example Scenario
A company with customers in the USA, Europe, and Asia:
- Uses **CloudFront** to deliver website content with low latency.
- Implements **Global Accelerator** to ensure users connect to the nearest healthy application endpoint.
- Uses **Direct Connect** for secure, high-performance connectivity between its on-premise data center and AWS.
